# bwplay-cli

`bwplay-cli` is a set of tools for building javascript-based games.
The tooling is designed to be minimal and flexible.

To try it out for yourself, check out our [getting started guide]({{< relref "getting-started.md" >}}).

## Features

* [Generate TypeScript code]({{< relref "code-generator.md" >}}) that handles loading external audio assets.
* [Run a development server]({{< relref "development-server.md" >}}) that automatically reloads your code and assets as they change.
* [Export your project]({{< relref "exporting.md" >}}) as an [Android project](https://developer.android.com/) or a [Progressive Web App (PAW)](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Progressive_web_apps).
